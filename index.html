           <p>Yukina is making the most of her junior year of high school, by spending it in the United States. She was the winner of the 2017 FCCLA-Kikkoman Exchange Scholarship, which allows her to live with an American family from August 2017—July 2018.</p>

                <p>With her American family, Yukina is experiencing all sorts of new things! She active in her adopted high school’s marching band FCCLA program. She also experienced her first American Homecoming with her group of friends. She’s taking English classes with native English speakers as part of her class schedule and is currently reading Harper Lee’s To Kill and Mockingbird at school. Speaking and hearing English all the time is difficult, but it is undeniable that her English skills are steadily improving every day.</p>

                <p>Living in southwest Iowa is very different from living in her native Okinawa. She thinks the weather is already too cold, and she misses being able to go to the beach after school. She is looking forward to seeing snow for the first time, though, and experiencing American culture outside of television shows. She thinks that American and Japanese high schools can learn a lot from each other because there are benefits to both systems.</p>

                    She prefers the academic exclusivity of Japanese high school as well as school uniforms. However, she admires American high schools because they encourage students to pursue personal interests and focus less stringently on test scores. Yukina is an intelligent and sweet girl who lights up any room she enters with her infectious smile, and I wish her all the best during her stay in the United States.
